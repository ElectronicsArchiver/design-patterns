<p class="lead">This is the list of all the Javascript modules we're using. Some we've borrowed, some we've written ourselves and others are a mix of the two. Before implementing any new Javascript functionality make sure the module is documented here.</p>

There are a couple of _General modules_ which are often utilities to use in other modules, _Component modules_, like [tabs](tabs.html) and [accordion](accordion.html), which are used in conjunction with CSS components to give them animation or functionality and a few _Third-party modules_, like [Grunticon](#), from third parties.

### Test-driven development

Ideally our Javascript modules will be unit-tested. Currently we don't have the knowledge or the capacity to implement stringent unit tests, but would like to implement this feature into future builds.
