<div class="lead"><p>Components are the essential building blocks of all our web pages. The [grid system](grid.html) deals with the underlying structure; the [Javascript modules](modules.html) add some interactivity and functionality, but the components are the essential elements of the pattern library.</p></div>

They're (roughly) organised into _atoms_, _molecules_ and _organisms_. In general, an atom is a single piece of code, a combination of two or three elements, bound together in a coherent package, like a [button](button.html). A molecule is a more complicated combination of atoms, like [pagination](pagination.html), and an organism is the most complex of all, perhaps combining several molecules together, such as a [form](forms.html).
