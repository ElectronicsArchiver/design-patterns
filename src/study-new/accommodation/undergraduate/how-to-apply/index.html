   	<h2>Key dates for 2015</h2>
<ul>
<li>12 May: Application system opens</li>
<li>31 July&nbsp;(12 noon BST): Accommodation guarantee deadline</li>
<li>17 August: Room offers start to go out</li>
</ul>
<h2>When to apply</h2>
<p>Our online application system is open now for 2015/16 accommodation applications.</p>
<p>You should apply once you have accepted York as your firm (first choice) or insurance (second choice), even if you have a conditional offer. You don't need to wait for your exam results.</p>
<p class="cta"><a href="https://accommodation.york.ac.uk/">Apply now for 2015/16 accommodation</a></p>
<h2>How to apply</h2>
<p>You can log in to our online application system using your University of York username and password. These are the details you use to log in to You@York.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/it-services/it/register/log-in/">Having problems logging in?</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>1. Your details</h3>
<p>Check the details that we have for you, and select your application type (single, couple or family).</p>
<h3>2. Your room and college preferences</h3>
<p>List in order of preference our accommodation room types and colleges. Each preference will specify a college, room type, whether the room is self-catered/catered, whether the room has an ensuite, and a let length. Here is an example preference:</p>
<p>[IMAGE - UPLOADED ABOVE]</p>
<p>You'll be asked to select a minimum of nine preferences. If room type is more important to you, you could put similar room types in different colleges at the top of your list. Or if you really want to be in a particular college but you don&rsquo;t mind what room you&rsquo;re in, you might want to select all the room types in that college and put those at the top instead. It's up to you!</p>
<p>If you're a&nbsp;<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">Nursing</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">Midwifery</strong>&nbsp;student, you'll see a smaller selection of rooms and be asked to select fewer preferences as we set aside particular blocks/flats for students doing shift work.</p>
<h3>3. Your accommodation factors</h3>
<p>Tell us which accommodation factors are&nbsp;<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">most important to you</strong>&nbsp;(unless you're a Nursing and Midwifery student).</p>
<p>If we cannot give you one of your preferences, we'll look at how you have ranked your accommodation factors. For example, if you really want an Economy room, you might put 'Bedroom type' at the top of your list, and select 'Economy'. Or having a catered room is important to you, you could put that at the top.</p>
<h3>4. Your additional requirements</h3>
<p>Tell us if you have any&nbsp;<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">additional requirements</strong>. Examples of additional requirements include:</p>
<ul>
<li>An ensuite, a catered/self-catered room, or an adapted or accessible room</li>
<li>A room on the ground floor, near a lift or within a college that is close to your academic department due to a mobility problem</li>
<li>A room close to a college tutor, in a designated quiet area, or within a flat with a small number of students sharing facilities.</li>
</ul>
<p>Think carefully about whether this applies to you, and make sure you let us know during your application. You'll have the chance to upload supporting evidence from your doctor or consultant to help us to offer you a suitable room (<a href="http://www.york.ac.uk/media/abouttheuniversity/supportservices/accommodationoffice/Guidance%20for%20GPs%20Supporting%20Additional%20Requirements%20Applications.pdf">guidance notes</a>).</p>
<p><strong data-redactor-tag="strong">Please don't wait until you have received a room offer to let us know about your additional requirements as we may not be able to find you a suitable room at that stage.</strong></p>
<h3>Next steps</h3>
<ol>
<li>We'll send you an email to confirm your application.</li>
<li>If you told us about any additional requirements, we'll contact you at conditional offer stage to discuss your requirements.</li>
<li>You can log back in and change your preferences or upload extra documents until&nbsp;31 July.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Your room offer</h2>
<p>We will start sending out room offers from&nbsp;<strong data-redactor-tag="strong">Monday 17 August 2015</strong>.</p>
<p>We'll send your room offer to your @york.ac.uk email address.You will have three days to accept your room offer, so you should make sure you have access to the internet during this time.<br /><br />When you accept your room, you'll be asked to make an online payment of &pound;300.00 (GBP). This in an advance payment and will be deducted from your first term's rent instalment.</p>
<p>This payment is non-refundable unless you can provide evidence that you are not able to take up your place at the University for reasons outside of your control. In these circumstances a &pound;50 cancellation fee will be deducted from your advance payment.</p>
<h2>How we allocate rooms</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you selected York as your firm (first) choice you'll receive priority over insurance (second) choice applicants and have a higher probability of receiving one of your preferences.</li>
<li>If you're a Clearing or Adjustment student, we'll try to help you with accommodation if it's still available.</li>
<li>We'll take date range into consideration, so it's worth submitting an application early even if you might want to change your preferences later.</li>
</ul>
<p>Not everyone will receive one of their accommodation preferences given the variety of our rooms and that some room types are oversubscribed. We'll look at how you have ranked the different accommodation factors if your preferred room choices are no longer available.</p>
<p>Whichever room type and college you are allocated to, we&rsquo;re sure that you will enjoy being a member of our collegiate community. We do operate a transfer system after the term has begun although we receive a relatively small number of requests to transfer because students settle very quickly into their college.</p>
